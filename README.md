# trello-gpt-clone

This an attempt to clone the trello app with summary feature with the help of chat GPT API
In this we aim to develop a Trello clone using Next. We’ll use React hooks for local state management and Zustand for global state manegmen. Furthermore, we’ll use the react-beautiful-dnd library to implement drag-and-drop functionalities within the project.
With the help of Chat-GPT we are adding summary feature to our notes,

The project will allow users to create, delete, and edit lists and tasks. ALL CRUD opperation are implented with the help of Appwrite Cloud. We will also be able to add and modify descriptions within the tasks. Moreover, we’ll be able to rearrange lists within the Trello board. The project will also allow us to rearrange tasks within lists and across different lists by dragging and dropping them at desired locations within a particular list.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
